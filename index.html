    <main class="library-container">
        <section class="library-grid">
            <article class="card" data-id="card-0">The line is made up of an <u data-link="card-12">infinite number of points</u>; the plane of an <u data-link="card-12">infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite number of planes;</u> the hypervolume of an infinite number of volumes . . . . No, unquestionably this is not—more geometrico—the best way of beginning my story. To claim that it is true is nowadays the <u data-link="card-19">convention of every made-up story</u>. Mine, however, is true.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-1">I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street, in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-2">I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features—or perhaps it was my <u data-link="card-22"> myopia</u> that made them seem that way. Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from <u data-link="card-16">the Orkneys.</u></article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-3">I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of <u data-link="card-18">gloom emanated from him</u> - as it does now from me.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-4">I sell <u data-link="card-5"> Bibles</u>,' he said.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-5">Somewhat pedantically, I replied, 'In this house are several English Bibles, including the first— <u data-link="card-13"> John Wiclif's</u>. I also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's—which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst—and a Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need of.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-6">After a few moments of silence, he said, 'I don't only sell Bibles. I can show you a <u data-link="card-4"> holy book</u> I came across on the outskirts of <u data-link="card-15">Bikaner</u>. It may interest you.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-7">He opened the suitcase and lay the book on a table. It was an <u>octavo volume</u>, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words <u data-link="card-5">'Holy Writ'</u> and, below them, <u data-link="card-6">'Bombay'</u>.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-8">Nineteenth-century, probably,' I remarked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I've never found out</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-9">I opened the book at random. <u data-link="card-5">The script was strange to me.</u> The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in double columns, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-10">It also bore a <u data-link="card-18">small illustration</u>, like the kind used in dictionaries—an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand. It was at this point that the stranger said, 'Look at the illustration closely. <u data-link="card-11">You'll never see it again.'</u> I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the anchor</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-11">'It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?' I said to <u data-link="card-19">hide my dismay</u>. 'No,' he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. 'I acquired the book in a <u data-link="card-6">town out on the plain</u> in exchange for a <u data-link="card-13">handful of rupees and a Bible</u>. Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called <u data-link="card-0">the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.</u>'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-12">The stranger asked me to <u data-link="card-11">find the first page</u>. I lay my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of <u data-link="card-18">pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.</u> 'Now find the last page.' Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely managed to stammer, 'This can't be.'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-13">Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, 'It can't be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is <u data-link="card-0">no more or less than infinite</u>. <u data-link="card-12">None is the first page, none the last</u>. I don't know why they're <u data-link="card-9">numbered in this arbitrary way</u>. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-14">Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, 'If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time.'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-15">His speculations irritated me. 'You are religious, no doubt?' I asked him. 'Yes, I'm a <u data-link="card-2">Presbyterian</u>. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having <u data-link="card-11">cheated the native</u> when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his <u data-link="card-19">devilish book</u>.'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-16">I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that I learned that he was a <u data-link="card-22">Scot from the Orkney Islands</u>. I told him I had a great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume. 'You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns,' he corrected.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-17">While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked, 'Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the <u data-link="card-21">British Museum</u>?' 'No. I'm offering it to you,' he said, and he stipulated a rather <u data-link="card-11">high sum for the book</u>.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-18">I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was <u>out of my reach</u>, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme. 'I propose <u data-link="card-11">a swap</u>,' I said. 'You got this book for a handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and my black-letter Wiclif Bible. I inherited it from my ancestors.'</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-19">A black-letter Wiclif!' he murmured. I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the leaves and studied the title page with all the <u data-link="card-5">fervor of a true bibliophile</u>. 'It's a deal,' he said. It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell the book.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-20"><u data-link="card-7">We talked about India</u>, <u data-link="card-16">about Orkney</u>, and about the Norwegian jarls who once ruled it. It was night when the man left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-21">I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the <u data-link="card-18">space left on the shelf by the Wiclif</u>, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and One Nights.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-22">I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the <u data-link="card-3">impossible book</u> and leafed through its pages. On one of them <u data-link="card-24">I saw engraved a mask</u>. The upper corner of the page carried a number, which I no longer recall, <u data-link="card-13">elevated to the ninth power</u>.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-23">I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-24">These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. <u data-link="card-30">A prisoner of the book</u>, I almost never went out anymore.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-25">After studying its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-26">The small illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was not long in filling up. <u data-link="card-10">Never once was an illustration repeated.</u></article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-27">At night, in the meagre intervals my insomnia granted, <u data-link="card-24">I dreamed of the book.</u></article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-28">Summer came and went, and I realized that <u data-link="card-30">the book was monstrous.</u></article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-29">What good did it do me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less monstrous?</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-30">I felt that the book was a <u data-link="card-28">nightmarish object</u>, an obscene thing that affronted and tainted reality itself.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-31">I thought of fire, but I feared that the <u data-link="card-13">burning of an infinite book might likewise prove infinite</u> and suffocate the planet with smoke.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-32">Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-33">Before retirement, I worked on <u data-link="card-1">Mexico Street</u>, at the Argentine National Library, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-34">I knew that to the right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept.</article>
            <article class="card" data-id="card-35">One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the door, <u data-link="card-21">I lost the Book of Sand</u> on one of the basement's musty shelves.</article>
